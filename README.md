Project 2 Requirements


Our project must be properly commented, cited, indented, abide by naming conventions, be written in Java, and proofread. 

No line may be longer than 120 characters. 

Our project will be a grocery list with food objects. It will employ an array list to act as the grocery list.

The food objects will include: section of grocery store, price, and name, so they can be sorted by our sorting methods. (These requirements may change depending on Mr. Hansenâ€™s feedback and our abilities)

We will use the following methods to sort the grocery list by the aforementioned groupings. 

Method to swap two objects on the list. 

Method to add and remove items from the list, with the choice to add at any spot. 

Method to move an item to another point on the list, moving all other items back one.

The user will also be able to print the list. The list must utilize the following methods:

int size()

boolean add(E obj)

Void add(int index, E obj)

E get(int index)

E set(int index, E obj)

E remove(int index)
